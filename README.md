# Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction** project! This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques, specifically aiming to determine whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay based on various factors. By leveraging advanced algorithms like **CatBoost**, **XGBoost**, and **LGBM**, the project seeks to provide actionable insights for businesses to improve customer retention strategies.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to build an accurate machine learning model that predicts if a customer will churn, using a dataset with relevant features such as customer behavior, demographics, and subscription details.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
- **Model Training**: Hyperparameter tuning using advanced algorithms like **CatBoost**, **XGBoost**, and **LGBM**.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.
- **Insights**: Analyzing which variables are most predictive of customer churn.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: The project begins by collecting the dataset, followed by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical values.
2. **Model Training**: Three popular machine learning algorithmsâ€”**CatBoost**, **XGBoost**, and **LGBM**â€”are used to build and train predictive models.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning is performed using grid search and cross-validation techniques to find the optimal model configurations.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess their effectiveness.
5. **Prediction**: After evaluation, the final model predicts whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- **CatBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that handles categorical features efficiently.
- **XGBoost**: A widely used gradient boosting framework known for its performance and speed.
- **LGBM**: LightGBM, an efficient and scalable gradient boosting framework, optimized for large datasets.

### Model Comparison

The following table summarizes the performance of the models:

| Model       | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| **CatBoost** | 85.5%    | 84%       | 87%    | 85.5%    | 0.91    |
| **XGBoost**  | 84.2%    | 83%       | 85%    | 84%      | 0.90    |
| **LGBM**     | 83.7%    | 82%       | 84%    | 83%      | 0.89    |

From the table, we can see that **CatBoost** outperforms the other models in terms of **accuracy** and **ROC-AUC**. It provides the best trade-off between precision and recall, making it the most reliable model for predicting customer churn in this case.


## ðŸ”§ Future Improvements

While the current models perform well, there are several areas for improvement that can help further enhance accuracy and usability:

- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementing deep learning models, such as neural networks, to compare performance with traditional gradient boosting algorithms.
- **Data Augmentation**: Exploring synthetic data generation methods to improve model robustness and handle imbalances in the dataset.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Integrating the model into a real-time system to provide businesses with timely insights on customer churn.
- **Feature Engineering**: Further investigation into creating new features or utilizing domain knowledge to increase model accuracy.

These improvements can make the model even more accurate and scalable, offering better predictions in dynamic environments.
